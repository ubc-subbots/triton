# <h3>**How to launch script**</h3>
After sourcing ros2 and browsing to the **triton_gui** subdirectory to launch the recording script use the following command:
`python3 keyboard_control.py`

This will launch the keyboard controller. The keyboard controller uses the letter `r` to  record messages as rosbag messages.
After launching the python script as detailed above press and hold `r` from the keyboard to start recording ros messages.
To stop recording release the `r` key of the keyboard.
