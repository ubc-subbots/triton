# triton_gate
## Description

This package contains the nodes needed for performing gate detection and localization to be used on the gate task in competition

## Usage

Right now, you can launch the teleoperated simulation and see the gate detector working in RViz as such

    ros2 launch triton_bringup teleop_sim_bringup_launch.py

In RViz, you can see a row of images frame to the right, which has both raw camera views, the segmentation output, and gate bounding box output.

## Nodes

- `gate_detector` : A component node (`triton_gate::GateDetector`) which aims to detect the gate by drawing a tightly-fitting bounding box around it.
